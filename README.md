# Transformation-Matrices-in-OpenGL

The goal of the project is to compute all the transformation matrices with your library instead of using OpenGL library. 
Since you are relying on OpenGL for final rasterization, you have to let OpenGL know what the final transformation matrix is, 
so that it transforms the vertices and triangles and does the final rasterization.
